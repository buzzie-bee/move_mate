Inventory tracking app for home removals

Very early stages of development. Auth is implemented.

The plan is to be able to scan barcodes (possibly orderable from within the app) on home removals boxes and to store images (and maybe lists) of the contents of each box.

When arriving at your destination you can then quickly scan the codes on the boxes to check everything arrived. You can then quickly find out which box has the items you want to get from storage without having to rummage through them all.
